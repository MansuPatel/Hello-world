Hi Hannah, as promised on the cold showers for covid topic I did search to gather up many links to help  show what I mean about the potential of cold shower boosted T cell levels being a protective measure against covid and I've trimmed the number of links down to help avoid causing you soar eyes, and by searching through I found the best two links which quickly seem to vaidate 1)T cells could be a covid beating key, and that 2) cold showers is a shown method for increasinng those T cell levels 

So here in the first link of two
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52754280    :- Coronavirus: Immune clue sparks treatment hope

Just after the first picture on the page it says :-

"UK scientists are to begin testing a treatment that it is hoped could counter the effects of Covid-19 in the most seriously ill patients.

It has been found those with the most severe form of the disease have extremely low numbers of an immune cell called a T-cell.

T-cells clear infection from the body."


====== Then here in the second of the pair of links it it describes how cold showers can be used to increase the levels of T cells ( also called T lymphocytes), plus like this grantimg us each the bonus of some added cancer protection

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2211456/  -  Possible stimulation of anti-tumor immunity using repeated cold stress: a hypothesis

in the first content section where the headings say :-

"Abstract
Background"

 it then states that 
".... In particular, there is accumulating evidence that daily brief cold stress can increase both numbers and activity of peripheral cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, the major effectors of adaptive and innate tumor immunity, respectively. "

So hopefully even just from these above two links you might also be able to see how this web jigsaw might reveal the picture of how cold showers could be a tool to help stop this pandemic (it turns out that in the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 cold showers also helped protect many people), but just in case .... here are some of the other links which you can look in to, some of which say about how they are already hoping to crate T cell vaccines cos it could have better lasting protection against variants->

And also just incase you might be thinking that it such an impossible far fecthed idea that we could convince people to take cold showers, recently I also discovered that Wim Hof- the Ice Man is now having a film made about his chilled out adventures and how he is helping more people all over the world to discover his chilled out healing methods :-

https://variety.com/2022/film/global/the-iceman-biopic-joseph-fiennes-kevin-macdonald-1235165103/

Then who knows perhaps we could even ask him if he might like to add an extra chapter in the story of his film, where with the aid of a Forgotten returnee who beat impossible odds to still survive when he got struck down by a mystery illness called encephaltis and lost his memory, whilst he was on this spiritual origins searching adventures in India, with this aid the next chapter in the Wim Hoff story could show how he then started the Cold shower T cell boosting world revolution to unite people in lands near and far to create the pandemic defeating Healing Task Force, which then had the bonus side effect of striking some global sized emissions reduction blows to also help cure our Mother Earth of any further risks of climate change. And if he might need any convincing about the plausabilty of  this happy ending to the plot of his film then I could tell him how I was granted the name of the medicine Buddha which then led me to discover cold showers and I could  show him how each morning now I open the window before starting my cold shower, which I then enjoy to practice with my extra added practice of chanting the "Nonstop Ganesha Mantra" with my added rhythmmic touch of beatboxing and what I now call my "Human BellyBashing" ;)      and also show him how now my gas meter has always counted zero units used for the last 9 years since my daily dose of cold showers had the extra healing effect of liberating me for the dependency on heating systems

Kind Regards,

We'd love to hear from you
Do you have any other ideas that are currently missing from our toolkits? Or do you have any suggestions on how to make our toolkits easier to use? Perhaps you have some ideas on tackling climate change?

Is drumming good for anxiety?
Research by the Royal College of Music has found that drumming has a positive impact on mental health, with a 10-week programme of group drumming reducing depression by as much as 38% and anxiety by 20%.

==========================
Although pandemic findings have said - "It has been found those with the most severe form of the disease have extremely low numbers of an immune cell called a T-cell.T-cells clear infection from the body." - https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52754280 

Although this is  the case T cells are also called T lymphocytes, and in other cancer studies it found that T lymphocytes levels can be boosted - "Possible stimulation of anti-tumor immunity using repeated cold stress: a hypothesis.... In particular, there is accumulating evidence that daily brief cold stress can increase both numbers and activity of peripheral cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, the major effectors of adaptive and innate tumor immunity, respectively."  -  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2211456/ 


researchers found that listening to and playing music increase the body's production of the antibody immunoglobulin A and natural killer cells, which are a type of T cell

"Scientific studies have found that chanting can decrease stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as increase positive mood, feelings of relaxation and focused attention,"
